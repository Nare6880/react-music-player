# Introduction 
* The purpose of this music player project, named "Melodius", is to provide users with a 
convenient and intuitive way to listen to their favorite music. The music player will be built 
using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS, which are widely used and well-supported technologies in 
web development. 
* The user interface will be designed for simplicity and ease of use, and we will be researching 
and testing with real users to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations. The goal is 
to create a music player that enhances the user's music listening experience by providing a 
personalized and seamless way to access and play their music library.
* The music player is a web application because this allows us to target a wider audience with 
few drawbacks compared to a native application as you can add web pages to the Home 
Screen. With just a minor drawback on mobile we can target all platforms with one web app 
instead of at least 3 separate versions
